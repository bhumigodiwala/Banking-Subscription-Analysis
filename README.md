**Banking Subscription Analysis**

The project aims at performing the Banking Subscription Analysisof a Portuguese Banking Institution. 
The classification task is performed using Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning techniques. It 
involves converting a supervised dataset to a semi-supervised one using data processing techniques and 
compare the analysis performance f various Supervised and Semi-Supervised Algorithms. It includes implementation
of Supervised Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
Random Forests and Support Vector Machines and Semi-supervised learning algorithms,
we intend to useself-training, label propagation, co-training, label spreading, S3VM and
Semi-Supervised Gaussian Mixture Models.

The performance metric used is Accuracy
Score, F1 Score and Confusion Matrix
